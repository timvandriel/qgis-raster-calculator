    Calculate accumulated cost distance, traceback, and allocation.

    This function uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the many-sources
    shortest-paths solution for a given cost surface. Valid moves are from a
    given pixel to its 8 nearest neighbors. This produces 3 2D arrays. The
    first is the accumulated cost distance, which contains the
    distance-weighted accumulated minimum cost to each pixel. The cost to move
    from one pixel to the next is ``length * mean(costs[i], costs[i+1])``,
    where ``length`` is 1 for horizontal and vertical moves and ``sqrt(2)`` for
    diagonal moves. The provided scaling factor informs the actual distance
    scaling to use. Source locations have a cost of 0. If `elevation` is
    provided, the length calculation incorporates the elevation data to make
    the algorithm 3D aware.

    The second array contains the traceback values for the solution. At each
    pixel, the stored value indicates the neighbor to move to in order to get
    closer to the cost-relative nearest source. The numbering is as follows:
        5  6  7
        4  X  0
        3  2  1
    Here, X indicates the current pixel and the numbers are the neighbor
    pixel positions. 0 indicates the neighbor immediately to the right and
    6 indicates the neighbor immediately above. In terms of rows and columns,
    these are the neighbor one column over and one row above, respectively. a
    value of -1 indicates that the current pixel is a source pixel and -2
    indicates that the pixel was not traversed (no data or a barrier).

    The third array contians the source allocation for each pixel. Each pixel
    is labeled based on the source location that is closest in terms of cost
    distance. The label is the value stored in the sources array at the
    corresponding source location.

    Parameters
    ----------
    costs : 2D ndarray
        A 2D array representing a cost surface.
    sources : 2D int64 ndarray
        An array of sources. The values at each valid location, as determined
        using `sources_null_value`, are used for the allocation output.
    sources_null_value: int
        The value in `sources` that indicates a null value.
    elevation : 2D ndarray, optional
        An array of elevation values. Same shape as `costs`. If provided, the
        elevation is used when determining the move length between pixels.
    elevation_null_value : scalar, optional
        The null value for `elevation` data. Default is 0.
    scaling : scalar or 1D sequence, optional
        The scaling to use in each direction. For a grid with 30m scale, this
        would be 30. Default is 1.

    Returns
    -------
    cost_distance : 2D ndarray
        The accumulated cost distance solution. This is the same shape as the
        `costs` input array.
    traceback : 2D ndarray
        The traceback result. This is the same shape as the `costs` input
        array.

    """Calculate accumulated cost distance, traceback, and allocation.

    This function uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the many-sources
    shortest-paths solution for a given cost surface. Valid moves are from a
    given pixel to its 8 nearest neighbors. This produces 3 rasters. The
    first is the accumulated cost distance, which contains the
    distance-weighted accumulated minimum cost to each pixel. The cost to move
    from one pixel to the next is ``length * mean(costs[i], costs[i+1])``,
    where ``length`` is 1 for horizontal and vertical moves and ``sqrt(2)`` for
    diagonal moves. The `costs` raster's resolution informs the actual scaling
    to use. Source locations have a cost of 0. If `elevation` provided, the
    length calculation incorporates the elevation data to make the algorithm 3D
    aware.

    The second raster contains the traceback values for the solution. At each
    pixel, the stored value indicates the neighbor to move to in order to get
    closer to the cost-relative nearest source. The numbering is as follows:
    ::

        6  7  8
        5  X  1
        4  3  2

    Here, X indicates the current pixel and the numbers are the neighbor
    pixel positions. 1 indicates the neighbor immediately to the right and
    7 indicates the neighbor immediately above. In terms of rows and columns,
    these are the neighbor +1 column over and +1 row above, respectively. a
    value of 0 indicates that the current pixel is a source pixel and -1
    indicates that the pixel was not traversed due to a null value.

    The third raster contains the source allocation for each pixel. Each pixel
    is labeled based on the source location that is closest in terms of cost
    distance. The label is the value stored in the sources raster at the
    corresponding source location.

    Parameters
    ----------
    costs : Raster or raster path
        A raster representing a cost surface. Values less than 0 are treated as
        null values.
    sources : Raster or raster path, or sequence
        A raster or sequence of indices. If a raster, pixels that are not null
        are used as source locations. The raster must have a null value set.
        The values at valid locations are used as the corresponding values in
        the allocation output. If a sequence, must have shape (M, 2) where M is
        the number of source pixels. Each item represents an index into `costs`
        to be used as a source. The element number, starting at 0, is used as
        the corresponding allocation value.
    elevation : Raster or raster path, optional
        A raster containing elevation values on the same grid as `costs`. If
        provided, the elevation values are used when calculating the travel
        distance between pixels. This makes the algorithm 3D aware.

    Returns
    -------
    cost_distance : Raster
        The accumulated cost distance solution. This is the same shape as the
        `costs` input Raster and has the same null value.
    traceback : Raster
        The traceback result. This is the same shape as the `costs` input
        Raster.
    allocation : Raster
        The allocation result. This is the same shape as the `costs` input
        Raster.

    See cost_distance_analysis for a full description.

    Parameters
    ----------
    costs : Raster or raster path
        A raster representing a cost surface. Values less than 0 are treated as
        null values.
    sources : Raster or raster path, or sequence
        A raster or sequence of indices. If a raster, pixels that are not null
        are used as source locations. The raster must have a null value set.
        The values at valid locations are used as the corresponding values in
        the allocation output. If a sequence, must have shape (M, 2) where M is
        the number of source pixels. Each item represents an index into `costs`
        to be used as a source. The element number, starting at 0, is used as
        the corresponding allocation value.
    elevation : Raster or raster path, optional
        A raster containing elevation values on the same grid as `costs`. If
        provided, the elevation values are used when calculating the travel
        distance between pixels. This makes the algorithm 3D aware.

    Returns
    -------
    cost_distance : Raster
        The accumulated cost distance solution. This is the same shape as the
        `costs` input Raster.
